```

### Key Components

#### Core Application (App.tsx)
- Central routing logic for different pages
- Global state management (cart, orders, user data)
- Modal and popup management
- Navigation between stores and pages

#### Page Components
- **Store Pages**: Display individual store catalogs and products
- **Cart & Checkout**: Shopping cart management and order processing
- **Merchant Dashboard**: Store management interface for merchants
- **Authentication**: Login and store creation flows

#### UI Components

## Data Management

### Client-Side Storage

The application uses browser localStorage for persistent data:

```typescript
// Cart persistence
localStorage.setItem('eshro_cart', JSON.stringify(cartItems));

// Order history
localStorage.setItem('eshro_orders', JSON.stringify(orders));

// User preferences and favorites
localStorage.setItem('eshro_favorites', JSON.stringify(favorites));
```

### Data Structures

#### Product Data
```typescript
interface Product {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  price: number;
  images: string[];
  sizes: string[];
  colors: Color[];
  category: string;
  inStock: boolean;
}
```

#### Store Data
```typescript
interface Store {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  slug: string;
  logo: string;
  categories: string[];
  endpoints: {
    products: string;
    discounts: string;
  };
}
```

#### Order Data
```typescript
interface Order {
  id: string;
  items: CartItem[];
  total: number;
  shipping: ShippingInfo;
  payment: PaymentInfo;
  status: OrderStatus;
}
```

### Static Data Management

Product catalogs, store information, and configuration data are managed through static TypeScript files in the `data/` directory, providing:

- **Product Categories**: Hierarchical categorization system
- **Store Listings**: Registered merchant stores with metadata
- **Payment Methods**: Available payment options and configurations
- **Shipping Zones**: Delivery areas and pricing
- **Partner Data**: Banking, payment, and logistics partners
